## Who is the course for?

This course is intended for healthcare supply chain researchers, practitioners, and students who want to model uncertainty in logistical systems using **Markov Chains**. It assumes familiarity with basic probability and matrix manipulation in R.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the structure and assumptions of **discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs)**
* Apply transition matrices to simulate system evolution over time
* Compute and interpret **steady-state distributions**
* Model brand switching and service reliability in healthcare supply chains
* Simulate long-run outcomes and interpret them visually in R
* Link model insights to supply chain policy decisions (e.g. stockouts, demand, brand promotion)

## Prerequisites

* Comfortable with **basic probability** (random variables, distributions)
* Familiarity with **R and tidyverse** for matrix operations and plotting
* No prior knowledge of Markov chains is assumed
